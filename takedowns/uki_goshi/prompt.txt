"Recreate this BJJ Uki Goshi (Floating Hip Throw) in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero with lighter hip contact than O Goshi, arm around opponent's waist. Hero floats opponent over hip with circular motion, using rotation more than lifting. Subtle hip throw variation. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
