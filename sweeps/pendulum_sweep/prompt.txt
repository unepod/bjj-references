"Recreate this BJJ Pendulum Sweep in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero on back, opening guard and swinging leg high like a pendulum to generate momentum. Hero grips opponent's arm and collar, using swinging leg's momentum to off-balance and sweep opponent. Hero follows the sweep to mount position. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
