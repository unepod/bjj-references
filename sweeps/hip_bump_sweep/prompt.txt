Hero sits up explosively from closed guard, posting on one hand behind while bumping hips into opponent. Hero's chest drives into opponent while free arm wraps over opponent's shoulder. Hero uses momentum to sweep opponent onto their back. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
