"Recreate this BJJ Tripod Sweep in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero on back, one foot on opponent's hip, other foot hooking behind opponent's ankle. Hero grips opponent's same-side sleeve and opposite ankle. Hero pushes hip while pulling ankle and reaping the supporting leg, toppling opponent like a tripod losing a leg. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
