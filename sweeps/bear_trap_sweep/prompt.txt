"Recreate this BJJ Bear Trap Sweep in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero from half guard, trapping opponent's leg in bear trap configuration - both legs wrapped tight around one of opponent's legs. Hero uses the trapped leg leverage to off-balance and sweep opponent to the side. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
