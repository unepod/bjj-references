Hero grips opponent's sleeves, extending legs fully to elevate opponent like a balloon overhead. Hero uses momentum to roll opponent over and come up to top position. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
