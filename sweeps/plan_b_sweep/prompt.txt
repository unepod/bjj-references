Hero from half guard when primary sweep is defended, transitioning to backup sweep option. Hero adjusts grips and angle, using opponent's defense momentum against them to complete the alternative sweep. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
