"Recreate this BJJ Fifty-Fifty Knee Push Sweep in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero in 50/50 leg entanglement, both fighters' legs intertwined symmetrically. Hero pushes on opponent's knee while using leg entanglement as leverage, forcing opponent to their back. Hero maintains leg control throughout sweep. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
