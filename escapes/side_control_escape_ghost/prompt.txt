Hero under side control, sneaking arm through and sliding body underneath opponent. Hero threads through the space like a ghost, emerging on the other side or taking the back. Slick technical escape. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
