"Recreate this BJJ Mount Escape Heel Drag in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero under mount, using heel to drag opponent's foot over own leg. Hero hooks opponent's foot with heel while shrimping, pulling leg across to establish half guard. Sneaky guard recovery technique. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
