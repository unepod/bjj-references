"Recreate this BJJ Log Splitter Pass in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero in opponent's half guard, wedging knee between opponent's legs to split them apart. Hero drives knee down like splitting a log, freeing trapped leg while maintaining shoulder pressure. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
