"Recreate this BJJ Loop Choke in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero on back in guard, one hand gripping deep in opponent's collar with thumb inside, creating a loop. As opponent postures up, hero feeds own head through the loop while pulling collar tight. Hero rolls to side, using the loop and rotation to complete the choke. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
