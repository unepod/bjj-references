"Recreate this BJJ Kimura from Guard in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero lies on back in closed guard position, hip escaped to the side. Hero controls opponent's wrist with one hand while the other arm loops over opponent's tricep to grab own wrist, forming figure-four grip. Opponent's arm bent at 90 degrees, elbow away from body. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
