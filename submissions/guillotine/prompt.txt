"Recreate this BJJ Guillotine Choke in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero wraps arm around opponent's neck from the front, opponent's head tucked under hero's armpit. Hero grips own wrist or clasps hands together, pulling upward on neck while leaning back. Hero's legs wrapped in closed guard around opponent's waist for control. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
