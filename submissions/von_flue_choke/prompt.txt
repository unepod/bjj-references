Hero in side control on top, opponent attempting guillotine from bottom. Hero drives shoulder into opponent's neck on the guillotine side, using body weight to compress. Hero's head posted on mat, hips heavy, cutting off blood flow using opponent's own arm against them. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
