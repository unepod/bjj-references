Hero mounted on opponent, pulling opponent's own lapel across their neck. Hero grips the lapel with one hand while other hand controls or reinforces. Hero uses lapel as choking surface, pulling tight across throat while maintaining mount pressure. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
