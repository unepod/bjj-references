"Recreate this BJJ Baseball Bat Choke in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero from knee on belly or north-south, gripping opponent's collar with both hands positioned like holding a baseball bat - one palm up, one palm down. Hero spins around opponent's head while maintaining grips, tightening the choke as body rotates. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
