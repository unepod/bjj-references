"Recreate this BJJ Ten Finger Guillotine in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero wraps arm around opponent's neck from front, clasping all ten fingers together in gable grip under opponent's chin. Hero in closed guard, squeezing elbows together while arching back to apply choking pressure. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
