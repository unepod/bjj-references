"Recreate this BJJ Arm-In Guillotine in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero wraps arm around opponent's neck with opponent's arm trapped inside the choke alongside their neck. Hero cups opponent's chin with chinstrap grip while other hand reinforces. Hero's closed guard controls opponent, leaning back to apply pressure. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
