"Recreate this BJJ Bow and Arrow Choke in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero behind opponent with back control, one hand gripping deep on opponent's collar near neck with thumb inside. Hero's other hand controls opponent's far leg at the pants. Hero extends body to the side, pulling collar while pushing leg away, bending opponent like drawing a bow. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
