"Recreate this BJJ High Elbow Guillotine in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero with arm wrapped around opponent's neck, elbow raised high pointing toward ceiling. Choking hand grips own wrist, creating tight angle on neck. Hero's closed guard controls opponent's hips. Hero leans back and to the side while lifting elbow, maximizing choke pressure. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
