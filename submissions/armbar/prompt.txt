Hero lies perpendicular to opponent with hips tight against opponent's shoulder, one leg across opponent's chest and one leg over opponent's head controlling posture. Hero grips opponent's wrist with both hands, pulling down while bridging hips upward to hyperextend the elbow. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
