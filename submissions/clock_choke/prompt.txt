Hero attacking from turtle, one hand gripping deep in opponent's far collar, other hand controlling near hip or belt. Hero walks in a circular motion around opponent's head like clock hands, tightening collar grip while sprawling weight down. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
