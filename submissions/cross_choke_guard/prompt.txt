Hero on back in closed guard, hands crossed and gripping deep inside opponent's collar, thumbs inside. Hero breaks opponent's posture down, pulling them close while tightening the cross grip. Hero's legs wrapped around opponent's waist controlling distance. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
