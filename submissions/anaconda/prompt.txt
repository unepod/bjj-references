"Recreate this BJJ Anaconda Choke in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero in front headlock position, arm wrapping around opponent's neck from the outside, threading under opponent's armpit. Hero grabs own bicep forming figure-four grip, rolling toward trapped arm side. Opponent's arm and head trapped in the squeeze. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
