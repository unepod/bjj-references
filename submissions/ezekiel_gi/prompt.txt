"Recreate this BJJ Ezekiel Choke (Gi) in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero in mount, one arm wrapped behind opponent's head gripping inside own sleeve. Other hand threads through the sleeve opening, forearm blade pressing across opponent's throat. Hero uses gi sleeve as lever while applying choking pressure. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
