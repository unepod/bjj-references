"Recreate this BJJ Japanese Necktie in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero from front headlock position, arm wrapped tight around opponent's neck. Hero steps leg over opponent's back similar to peruvian necktie but rotates to side. Hero grabs own bicep with free hand, creating figure-four lock while sprawling to finish choke. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
