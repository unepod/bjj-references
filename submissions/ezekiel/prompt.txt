Hero in mount position, one arm wrapped behind opponent's head. Other hand threads inside the first arm's sleeve/wrist area, forearm pressing across opponent's throat. Hero drives forearm down while pulling head up with wrapped arm, creating scissoring pressure on neck. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
