"Recreate this BJJ Americana from Mount in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero mounted on opponent's torso, pinning opponent's arm to the mat with figure-four grip. Hero's near hand grips opponent's wrist, far arm threads under opponent's elbow grabbing own wrist. Hero paints opponent's hand toward their hip while keeping elbow pinned, creating shoulder lock. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
