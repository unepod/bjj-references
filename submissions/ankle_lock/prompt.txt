Hero in ashi garami position, wrapping arm around opponent's ankle with wrist blade against Achilles tendon. Hero clasps hands together or grips own wrist, falling back while extending hips into opponent's trapped leg. Hero's legs control opponent's leg, preventing escape. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
