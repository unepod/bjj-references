"Recreate this BJJ Kimura from Side Control in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero in side control position on top, chest pressing down on opponent. Hero isolates opponent's near arm with figure-four grip - one hand on wrist, other arm loops over tricep grabbing own wrist. Hero rotates opponent's arm behind their back toward their head. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
