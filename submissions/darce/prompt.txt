"Recreate this BJJ D'Arce Choke in minimalist technical vector art style. Hero (executing technique) in white Gi, opponent in blue Gi (#2772b6). Hero beside opponent, threading arm under opponent's armpit and around neck from the front. Hero's choking arm grabs own bicep of the arm behind opponent's head, forming figure-four. Hero sprawls weight down while squeezing, opponent's arm trapped inside the choke. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
