Hero threads arm through to create figure-four on opponent's arm, using leg and arm together to attack shoulder in unique angle. Thick black outlines, flat solid colors, clean geometric shapes. High-angle isometric view. Faceless figures, no facial features. Isolated on light grey background (#E0E0E0). High contrast."
